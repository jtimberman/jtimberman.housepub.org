        </h3><p>Opscode Developer John Keiser
<a href="https://twitter.com/jkeiser2/status/388460927026085888">mentioned</a>
that a feature for Chef Zero he’s been working on, “local mode,” is
now in Chef’s master branch. This means it should be in the next
release (11.8). I took the liberty to check this <em>unreleased</em> feature
out.</p>

changes that have happened to Ruby lately, and thought I’d share my findings.</p>

        </h3><p>Over the past 20 years, I always had a Windows (or DOS!) PC as the
main system I use at home. The primary purpose was for gaming,
although building my own systems is also a hobby. In 2007, I wanted to
build a new system to use as a home theater PC. Originally, I built it
with Windows Vista - Windows Media Center <em>was</em> Vista’s killer app! I
painstakingly installed software, tweaked system settings and tuned
the registry. Then Windows 7 came along with further
improvements. After almost 20 years of reinstalling from scratch for
new versions of Windows, I treated this upgrade as no
different.</p>

        </h3><p>I moved my blog from Posterous to GitHub Pages. Posterous isn’t a bad
system and service. It just didn’t fit the way I wanted to manage my
site and the content. It was entirely adequate to get going but I was
dissatisfied with the web form for creating new posts. It also loaded
pages fairly slow.</p>
