I am Joshua Timberman.

You may know me from the years I spent writing about, presenting on, and contributing to the DevOps movement, Chef's open source products, and similar topics.

I am interested in technical operations, DevOps, SRE, application deployment, system automation, developer workflows, and open source communities. Historically, I wrote posts about Chef Software's products and projects I worked on while there. My tenure has come to an end, and I am working on expanding the areas where I write.

I'm pretty easy to find on the internet:
