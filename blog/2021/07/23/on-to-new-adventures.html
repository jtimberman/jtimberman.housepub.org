    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jtimberman/status/1404482295772241921">Well that didn’t go as expected</a>, I said on June 14th. “That” was a meeting I had with my manager at Sym. He scheduled the meeting to tell me they were letting me go, and my last day would be that Friday, the 18th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turned out the timing was not right for the position I was hired for, and they would not be ready to support me in that for months, at least. That is really all it amounted to - sometimes things don’t work out, especially in tech startups. Sym has a great product, and a team of great people, and I wish them all the best of luck.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have truly awesome #ChefFriends and a diverse network of awesome professional connections. Many of you reached out and offered to help, many of you offered advice and encouragement, and I appreciate you all. After three solid weeks of interviewing with a dozen different companies, I accepted an offer.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to announce that on Monday, July 26th, I am joining the team at <a href="https://allma.io/">Allma.io</a> as the Head of Advocacy and Community. The product fills a need that is near and dear to my heart - incident collaboration. As an operations leader of teams and organizations in incident response, I have wished for the kind of product that Allma has built, and there is so much more potential for collaborative workflows in the future. I look forward to helping grow those capabilities and make it a truly delightful platform for every organization.</p>
