    <p>I upgraded my work laptop to Mountain Lion today. It was not as smooth
as previous OS X upgrades have been for me, despite my efforts in
managing my workstation(s) with Chef.</p>

<p>I received a replacement laptop for the one that was damaged at
ChefConf a couple weeks ago (champagne spill - long story, maybe for
another blog post). As this is a new laptop, it is eligible for the
free Mountain Lion upgrade. So on ML release day, I submitted my
information to Apple for the redemption code, which I received this
morning. As I’m actually on vacation this week, I thought there was no
better time to upgrade.</p>

<p>You may recall that I have managed my
<a href="/blog/2011/04/03/managing-my-workstations-with-chef/">workstations</a>
<a href="/blog/2011/09/04/update-to-managing-my-workstations/">with Chef</a> for
quite some time. This has been all well and good so far, though the
Mountain Lion installation didn’t seem to like something in my
preferences along the way.</p>

<p>After the installation finished and the system rebooted, I logged in,
expecting to be greeted with my already configured system. This was
not the case, however! My desktop was that light grey of the OS X boot
screen, and the Dock was not running at all. I put on my
<a href="http://sysadminday.com">sysadmin hat</a> (like I ever take it off?!),
and started debugging. I found the issue pretty quickly.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll spare you the detail of the rest of the file. Suffice to say, it
is less informative than one might want for troubleshooting the issue.
I (foolishly) spent about an hour and a half trying to get to the root
of the problem. I found out that the problem was isolated to my own
user, and something between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/Preferences</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/Application Support</code>. I’m not sure what the problem was - I
eventually decided to just do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences ~/Library/Application\ Support
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I logged back in, and everything was well. I have a back up from
before the upgrade (Yay, TimeMachine!), so I wasn’t concerned with
losing anything important, and I knew that Chef would bring back most
of my settings anyway.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was, of course, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/chef-client</code>. This
worked great. Until the Dock was restarted as part of my recipes. The
symptom was the same as before - the desktop went light grey, the dock
wasn’t running and launchd was respawning it contnually, with the same
errors from above.</p>

<p>I decided to have some quality time with my configuration and get to
the bottom of the problem. I went through all the settings I modify
through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipe[mac_os_x::settings]</code> attributes, and did a careful
comparison of manual settings through the OS X system preferences, and
the files changed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/Preferences</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Side note</strong>: This handy hint comes from
  <a href="http://twitter.com/bleything">Ben Bleything</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/Library/Preferences
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, make a change in system preferences, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> to
see what plist files are updated. Of course, most of the plist files
are binary so you can’t really diff them, but the filename will
indicate which domain to use with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaults(1)</code> command. Handy,
thanks Ben! <strong>End side note.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, it took some time, but I tuned all my configuration for the
things I wanted to ensure happened on any new system, and nothing
else. I believe what happened is that some setting I had is no longer
supported on Mountain Lion and its presence makes Dock.app grumpy, but
that is purely speculation. The end result now, though, is that I have
a pretty sane set of configuration that is automatically applied in a
more data driven way, and I’m not using settings that I don’t know
100% what they do.</p>

<p>That aside, Mountain Lion is nice so far. The GCC Installer for 10.7
seems to be working just fine, though I haven’t tried installing a new
Ruby under it yet. I am looking forward to wider use and adoption of
the Notification Center as a replacement for Growl.</p>

<p>I hope this post is helpful in some way. Unfortunately I don’t have an
answer to the Dock crash problem itself, but I have now remedied the
issue for my own use. I’m going to write a new post about how I’m
managing my workstations, to bring the
