Hello there, traveler! It's been awhile, hasn't it, since I updated this page?

You see, I've been pretty busy since my last post in September, 2015. I moved back to the Chef Operations team, was promoted to a Principal Operations Engineer, and then made a career shift to become the Engineering Operations Manager of the team.

All that kept me pretty busy. I also had some real life things happening, and between it all, I just didn't have the time or energy to work on content for this site.

Fast forward to 2020, whilst we're in the middle of a global pandemic, [Chef was acquired by Progress](https://blog.chef.io/the-fourth-chapter-of-chef-has-arrived-progress-to-purchase-chef). I'll have more to [say about that](https://twitter.com/jtimberman/status/1303385915415392256) soon, don't worry. As such, I decided to revamp this site. I switched to Plain Ol' Jekyll from my Octopress install. I also decided to try out GitHub actions with it, and as such made the [repository for this site](https://github.com/jtimberman/jtimberman.housepub.org) public. After all, Nathen Harvey always teased me about having a private repository for my publicly available blog.

So, stay tuned. In the coming days I'm planning some content here around my next steps, and my thoughts on working for a single growth-based startup for nearly 13 years.

In the meantime, [here's a red panda up to some hijinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kizoZUyJK8w).
