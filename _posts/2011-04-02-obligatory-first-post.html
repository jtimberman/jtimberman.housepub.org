<p>My intention is to post about Linux/Unix system administration, Ruby development, Opscode's Chef and even more philosophical topics like devops, cloud computing, or really anything that strikes my fancy.</p>
<p>I'm probably going to post a lot about Chef. Most of this is my own personal exploration of the framework and testing for my personal usage. While I work for Opscode and you're free to ask me any time about Chef and the Opscode Platform, I post on this blog in my personal time. Not all the information here is canonical or even reflects the best way to go about doing <strong>anything,</strong>&nbsp;let alone with Chef.</p>
